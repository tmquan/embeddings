# Nemotron Embeddings Pipeline Requirements
# Python version: 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 (avoid 3.14 - too new for some packages)
#
# INSTALLATION:
#   conda activate emb
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# NOTE: RAPIDS packages (cudf, cuml, etc.) and nemo-curator are OPTIONAL
#       They are imported conditionally and not required for embedding extraction

# Core dependencies for dataset handling
# IMPORTANT: Version pinning for compatibility with downloaded datasets
datasets==2.19.2
huggingface_hub[cli]>=0.20.0
pyarrow==15.0.2

# Model and inference
torch>=2.0.0
transformers==4.45.2

# Distributed processing
ray[default]>=2.8.0

# Utilities
numpy==1.26.4
tqdm>=4.65.0
pandas>=2.0,<3.0  # pandas 3.0 incompatible with RAPIDS

# Optional: Flash Attention 2 (requires compatible GPU and CUDA)
# Uncomment if you have NVIDIA GPU with compute capability >= 8.0 (A100, H100, RTX 3090+)
# flash-attn>=2.3.0

# Optional: For better performance
# accelerate>=0.24.0
# bitsandbytes>=0.41.0  # For quantization

# NOTE: RAPIDS packages (cudf-cu13, cuml-cu13, cugraph-cu13, cupy-cuda13x, cuvs-cu13)
#       are already installed in the deploy environment via conda.
#       Do not try to install them via pip as it may cause conflicts.
